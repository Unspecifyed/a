<p>House design</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Initial Sketch with Pencil:</strong> I began by sketching the front profile of the house using a pencil and paper. This initial step allowed me to get a rough idea of the layout, proportions, and basic elements of the design. I focused on capturing the main features of the house, such as the roof, windows, doors, and any unique architectural details.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Adding Watercolors:</strong> Once I was satisfied with the pencil sketch, I introduced watercolors to add color and depth to the design. I applied watercolors to different parts of the sketch, carefully blending and layering the colors to create realistic shades and highlights. This step brought life to the design and helped me visualize how the final house might look.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Digital Enhancement with GIMP:</strong> After completing the watercolor stage, I scanned the hand-drawn sketch and imported it into GIMP, a digital image manipulation software. In GIMP, I used various tools to enhance the design further. This included refining lines, adjusting colors, and adding subtle details that might have been challenging to achieve with traditional media alone.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fine-Tuning and Details:</strong> During the GIMP phase, I focused on fine-tuning the design. I paid attention to intricate details such as textures, shadows, and reflections to create a more polished and realistic representation of the house. This step allowed me to correct any imperfections and make the design more visually appealing.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review and Iteration:</strong> After completing the digital enhancements, I reviewed the design to ensure that it aligned with my original vision. If I identified any areas that needed improvement or adjustments, I made necessary changes, sometimes going back to previous stages to refine certain elements.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Finalization and Export:</strong> Once satisfied with the design, I finalized the image in GIMP and made sure that it was ready for presentation. I considered factors such as image resolution, file format, and color accuracy. Finally, I exported the design as a digital file that could be easily shared or printed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Understanding the users is crucial</em></p>
