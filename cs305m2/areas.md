1. **Authentication**:
   - Verify that proper authentication mechanisms are in place for user access.
   - Ensure that user credentials are securely stored, transmitted, and validated.
   - Check for any authentication vulnerabilities like weak passwords, brute force attacks, or session fixation.

2. **Authorization**:
   - Review the application's access control mechanisms to ensure users can only access resources and perform actions they are authorized to.
   - Check for any misconfigurations that might allow unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

3. **Data Security**:
   - Assess data encryption mechanisms, especially for sensitive data stored in the application's database or transmitted over the network.
   - Verify that sensitive data is adequately protected from unauthorized access or disclosure.

4. **Input Validation and Sanitization**:
   - Ensure that user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent common security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and remote code execution.
   - Check for any security flaws related to command input and SpEL usage, as they can potentially lead to code injection vulnerabilities.

5. **Session Management**:
   - Review how user sessions are managed and secured.
   - Check for issues like session fixation, session hijacking, or insufficient session timeouts.

6. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Verify that error messages do not reveal sensitive information and are handled securely.
   - Ensure that logs are appropriately generated and reviewed for potential security incidents.

7. **Configuration Management**:
   - Check for secure configuration practices, especially for secrets and sensitive information.
   - Assess the application's resistance to common configuration-related security risks.
